        "D. To ignore stakeholder expectations and focus on the technical aspects"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Project management aims to balance the 'triple constraint' (or project management triangle) of time, cost, and scope. Meeting these within stakeholder expectations is the primary goal."
